# Node.js Twitter Bot
This guide will show you how to set up the basic functionalities of a Twitter automated account using ```node-js``` â€” You will need a Twitter account and API keys for this guide. Some possible use-cases for creating a Twitter automated account are to automatically tweet links to new social posts, to automatically tweet about world events as they happen, or to automatically interact with tweets from your favorite creator.

> **Warning**
> Twitter could possibly block the account associated with the bot. This would be catastrophic, so it is imperative that you take action to create a new Twitter account prior to creating a Twitter automated account and following this guide.

## Installation
To get started, download following [repository](https://github.com/juuswtf/twitter-bot/example) and ensure that it is installed properly. This will help setup the basic files required to begin.
```
git clone https://github.com/juuswtf/twitter-bot/example.git
```

## API Keys

Locate the file ".env" in the root of your project. This file stores local configuration variables that we can access. Open the file ".env" and paste your API keys in the corresponding locations. Be sure to replace the values with __your__ API keys.

```
appKey = ************************
appSecret = ************************
accessToken = ************************
accessSecret = ************************
```

## Dependencies

Before we configure the bot, we need to install its dependencies. In your terminal, enter the following:

```
$ npm install cron --save
$ npm install dotenv --save
$ npm install twitter-api-v2 --save
```

This will install all the dependencies required, below is an example of how the dependencies should appear within the package.json file after we've installed them:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "cron": "^2.1.0",
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "twitter-api-v2": "^1.12.8"
}
```
